            <h3 id="Reading">Reading</h3>
            <p> 
                I used to hate reading back in elementary!! My reading level was below average and I was struggling
                to read my assigned books. I was put into reading tutoring to help and it really did help. The
                tutoring definitely allowed me to appreciate and enjoy books. Since then, it opened up a rabbit 
                hole into all sorts of reading material. I really got into:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manga</li>
                <li>Novels</li>
                <li>Webtoons</li>
                <li>Manhwas</li>
            </ul>
            <p> 
                All this new material soon led to developing favorite characters and falling in love with world building.
                An example of this would be my current favorite manhwa, <span>Omnicient Readers Viewpoint</span>!! My favorite character
                is of course the MC <span>Kim Dokja</span>! There's more about ORV and Dokja if you visit

            <h3 id="Drawing">Drawing</h3>
            <p>
                I've been drawing since I was a kid, specifically since elementary. I later joined an art 
                club in middle school, slowly building my skills and meeting others with the same interests 
                in art. Once I got into highschool, I started taking real art classes and learned even more!
                Now that I'm in college and pursuing CS, art has continued to be my biggest hobbie that I
                spend the most time on. You can visit <strong><a target="_blank" href="My-Art-Pieces.html">My Art Pieces</a></strong> to see 
                some pieces I've done! :) (They're not that great, some are old and some are recent LOL)

            <p>
                I was exposed to video games from a young age. My older brother would save up all his money to get 
                his PlayStation consoles and games. Around this time, I never really played any games, but I would always
                watch him play everything! His favorite series was Kingdom Hearts and I remember finding that game to be
                my favorite to watch.<br>
                As I got older, I took an interest to actually start playing my brothers games. I started out
                with <span>Call of Duty Black Ops II</span> zombies. I'm surprised the graphics of the zombies didn't scare me back then.
                <br>
                My brother finally got the money to buy our first PC that we shared (my older brother, younger brother, and I)
                and I remember mainly playing <span>Roblox</span> and <span>Maple Story 2</span>.<br>
                Now, I have my own personal PC that I bought with my quinci√±era money. I really like playing <span>Minecraft</span> and romance 
                visual novels on it. But my favorite game right now isn't on my PC, it on my iPad!<br>
                I got into rythm games when <span>Friday Night Funkin</span> first came out, which then led me through the rabbit hole of 
                <span>Osu</span> and <span>Project Sekai</span>. Project Sekai is currently my favorite game to play! Visit <strong><a target="_blank" href="Video-Games.html">Games</a></strong>
                to know more about the games mentioned if interested!
