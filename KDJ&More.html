    <h3>His Character</h3>
    <!-- Requirement-1.P -->

        <!-- Requirement-1.Q -->
        <summary>Small spoilers plot wise. Read with causion.</summary>
        <p>
            Dokja is a sad character who's gone through plenty of hardships and has learned to cope through reading this 10-year 
            long series. He's been taught to read and re-read, so that's exaclty what he spent his time doing. Throughout highschool,
            he'd get bullied but reading helped him get through it. Being the son of a murder, what he read is all he would talk about to his mother.
            Even after being an employed CS graduate adult, he'd still read and be a loner with no real social skills. 
            <br> Once the world flipped, Dokja became this confident but not confident character since he was aware of the situation. He became
            a character where a reader (us) shouldn't read his thoughts and feelings to be face value. He became even more complex and deep to the readers the more
            you see him in each arc and how he thinks and interacts with story charcters, but also with those he knew from the real world. 
            <br> Overall, Dokja is a complex and deep main character that is determined to see his companions live a happy ending, even if he might
            not be apart of that ending.

    <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
        The more I read ORV, the more I find myself relating to Dokja. Reading is what helped him live all those years, and here I found
        myself reading his story while he read and lived his favorite character's story. It makes me feel like I'm not alone since I know there 
        are so many people reading Dokja's story along with me.<br>
        I also find his character to be quite charming. He's very dependable through out the story, where all of his companions rely on his commands
        in dreadful situations. And through his help, his friends became strong and loyal. Though he is charming, he can be funny and annoying.
        There are times where I will mentally face palm because he did something unbelievable. He lacks self-preservation like all MC's and I just
        want him to live in his happy ending with everone else.
